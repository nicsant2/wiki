## Divides
An integer x divides an integer y if and only if 
$$x ≠ 0$$
and 
$$y = kx$$for some integer k.

The fact that x divides y is denoted x|y.
$$ x | y $$

If x does not divide y, then that fact is denoted x∤y.

$$ x \nmid  y$$

If x divides y, then y is said to be a multiple of x, and x is a factor or divisor of y.


## Weirdness
with this definition, the statement
$$ 11 \mid 0$$
is a correct statement because:
$$ 0 = 11 \cdot 0 $$
