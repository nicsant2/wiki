Integer n is a composite if and only if 

$$ n > 1$$
and there is an integer m such that 
$$ 1 < m < n $$
and 
$$ m \mid n $$

## Relation to Prime
if n is an integer such that 
$$ n >  1 $$
then n is either prime or composite

##### explanation
Suppose n is not prime. Then there is a positive integer m such that m ≠ 1, m ≠ n, and m divides n. If m divides n, then m ≤ n. Since m is a positive integer, m ≥ 1. We have that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, m ≠ 1, and m ≠ n. Therefore 1 < m < n. Since m divides n, then n must be composite
