## Use of Data Structures
- *a particular way of organizing data to save time and memory*
- makes memory management more efficient
**Data**
- intelligent storing of data
**algorithms**
- to maintain and query the data

## Arrays
### Drawbacks
- array size fixed
- inserting and deleting an element is expensive
	- you must shift existing elements
- If there is insufficient contiguous size
	- then memory cannot be listed sequentially and memory saving fails
### Solution
- each element has a reference to the next element
	- order in memory does not matter
	- [Nodes](Nodes.md)
