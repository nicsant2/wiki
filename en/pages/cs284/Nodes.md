## Usage
- used to order things in memory in a *non-contiguous* manner
- has a data field and a reference to the next node
	- the last node has a reference to a null field
- chaining these together creates a [Linked List](Linked%20List.md)
## Methods
- calling the next reference
- getter for the value
- insertion
- the head of the list
## Drawbacks
- still needs to wait until memory is released
